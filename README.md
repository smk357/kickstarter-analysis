# kickstarter-analysis
A Kickstarter data analytics project

## Project Overview

The Goal of this project was to determine the relationship between outcomes (failed, successful, or canceled) and launch dates and funding goals from a broad Kickstarter dataset.

Anlayses were performed on a Kickstarter dataset that includes funding goals and pledged amount for various crowdfunded ventures, launch dates, number of backers, and other pertinent data, for a variety of Kickstarter campaigns across several countries.
